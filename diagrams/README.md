# Diagrams

This folder contains architecture diagrams in two formats:

- **`.md`** files (recommended): embed Mermaid diagrams in Markdown and render directly on **GitHub**.
- **`.mmd`** files: raw Mermaid source (kept for easy editing).

## Viewing on GitHub

Open any of the `.md` files in this folder. GitHub will render the Mermaid diagram automatically.

## Viewing in VS Code

1. Open a diagram `.md` file (e.g. `system-overview.md`)
2. Use **Markdown Preview** (⌘⇧V on macOS)
3. If Mermaid doesn't render in preview, install a Mermaid-capable extension, such as:
   - *Markdown Preview Mermaid Support* (or similar)

> Tip: Even if `.mmd` doesn't preview, the `.md` versions will work on GitHub.
